*Mathematical modelling of the impact of human mobility on DENV transmission*

### Aim & Scope

1. Build a mathematical model that incorporates epidemiological, entomological, demographic, and mobility-related influences on DENV transmission. 
2. Use the mathematical model to quantify the effect of human mobility on DENV transmission 
3. Evaluate current DENV intervention strategies & assess hypothetical future strategies
4. Build a policy-advice interfase
